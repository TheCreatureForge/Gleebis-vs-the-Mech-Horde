WELCOME TO GLEEBIS VS THE MECHANICAL HORDE!
This is a twin stick shooting roguelike! The controls are WASD to move our player Gleebis and IJKL to rotate and determine where he'll shoot.
Space Bar/Q to attack
E - will use abilities that you have obtained
U - will cycle through weapons you have!
O - will interact with the shop items and allow the player to move onto the next wave!

Good luck in trying to survive the mechanical horde and looking for hidden easter eggs within this Creature Forge project!
